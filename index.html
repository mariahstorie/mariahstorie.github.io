    <br>Hi! My name's Mariah and I have no idea how to make the image above smaller (I've played around a lot with the height and width values)
    <br>I was born in Bogata, Colombia and I've lived in Fayetteville, NY for thirteen years.
    <br>I am a Television, Radio and Film student at the Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University
    <br>I am minoring in Psychology!</p>
